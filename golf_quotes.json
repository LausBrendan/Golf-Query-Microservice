    "5": "Sergio Garcia: If you worry about making bogeys, it makes the game that much more difficult. You put more pressure on yourself without even noticing it. It makes a difference to take it easy when things aren\u2019t going right.",

    "7": "P.G. Wodehouse: Golf\u2026 is the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone, with the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball where it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well.",

    "27": "Mark McCumber: Forget the last shot. It takes so long to accept that you can\u2019t always replicate your swing. The only thing you can control is your attitude toward the next shot.",
    "28": "Phil Mickelson: I think it\u2019s more than whether or not you win or lose. It\u2019s having that opportunity on that final round, final nine, to come down the stretch with a chance to win.",
    "29": "Walter Hagen: You don\u2019t have the game you played last year or last week. You only have today\u2019s game. It may be far from your best, but that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Harden your heart and make the best of it.",
